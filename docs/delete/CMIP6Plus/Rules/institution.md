[Research Organisation Repository](ror.org) is a global, community-led registry of open persistent identifiers for research organizations. This gives us an ability to assign a unique identifier to each institution, which persists even after they have rebranded, merged, split, shut down, and re-emerged. 

*Rules* : <b> An alphanumeric string, 9 characters, defined by ROR.org </b>
