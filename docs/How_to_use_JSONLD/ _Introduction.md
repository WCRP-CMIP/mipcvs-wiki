There are several available methods to interact with the JSONLD files. 
Instructions on how to use these are found on each respective page within the sub menu. 


### Methods of interaction 

The main categories are: 
#### 1. Direct interaction
Using the files locally or from the GitHub Repository. This can be done in a number of ways: 
- local copy
- github online interface
- GET commands from a scripting language

#### 2. CMIPLD web browsing interface. 
This is a rudementary JSONLD static page that can access all the JSONld files. This can be used to:
- check file contents
- view context 
- perform framing requests
- explore available files
- quickly check entries using prefixes without the need for a full URL

#### 3. PyLD native python interface. 
This is the native library for interacting with JSONLD in python. This has the benefits of: 
- Extracting files in Python
- Framing 
- Performing complex checks and incorporating the CVs in a personal workflow. 

#### 4. The CMIP-LD CLI
A quick command line interface that allows dynamic JSON-LD file viewing in the terminal. 
- performs recursive fills
- allows the use of prefixes to easily access files
- colapsable and coloured JSON exploration in the terminal 
- outputs file contents or framing into a file. 


#### 5. CMIP-LD Python Library
A wrapper around PyLD with a number of useful tools and presets to ease the learning curve for non-technical and technical users. 
- A list of registerd LD repositories. 
- Can access and cross compare files both online and offline. 
- Recursive file population (extracts all nested (linked) entries into your file)
- Link Checker
- LD Network generator. 
- File Checker
- Easy Framer and file simplifier.
