## Mycelium: The Universe Network  
Since the inherent reason for selecting JSON-LD is its linked data component, it makes sense that we might want to explore the links and networks created between the repositories. 

To do this we can convert the full LD network into an RDF graph, and extract relevant information. We can take the different types of files and visualise the links between them, as well as recreating a network of each individual item and edge-bundling them for clarity. 

This method of visualisation can serve as a useful diagnostic in identifying errors in our files, and ensuring that there are no broken links within the system.
