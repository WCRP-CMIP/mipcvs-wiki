## Treemap 
This is a file size comparison of the JSON-LD files in all the registered repositories. 

In viewing the data this way, we can build a better understanding on the number of files, and their hierarchy. This can be helpful in identifying repositories which require more maintainance, or may not want to be downloaded in their entirety by the end user.
