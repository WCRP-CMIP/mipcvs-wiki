# Activity ID

???+ abstract "Instructions"

    The rule guides describe what is required to submit a new item, and how to correctly fill out the forms and avoid submission errors. 

## Name
This is where you specify the activity name. This must be _unique_ and must not change. Often acronyms (e.g.`CMIP` and `LESFMIP`) are used to describe the activity. 

*Rules* : <b> Unicode, `[A-z]`, case-sensitive.  </b>

## Activity URL 
To aid users to find out more about the activity, in CMIP6Plus we are requiring a URL describing it. This can be a fixed page on a website (ideal) or a link to the definition paper. 

*Rules* : <b> Existing URL string. Ideally this will work with both `http` and `https` </b>


## Long Name
Finally we require a long (desciptive) name of the activity that may be used to better identify the activity. 

*Rules* : <b> Unicode, free-form, text. </b>
