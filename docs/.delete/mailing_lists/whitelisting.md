# Whitelisting the CMIP server

As our mail server is relatively new, although all the required message headers and metadata have been set, emails may occasionally end up in the spam/quarantine folder. 

If you are having trouble recieving emails, or these are being flagged, you may have to add the WCRP-cmip domain to your whitelist. The most common solutions are provided below, although should you have any others, feel free to contact us, and we will add them to the list. 


## Microsoft

### 1. Open the safe-senders list
https://outlook.office365.com/mail/options/mail/junkEmail/safeSendersDomainsV2

### 2. Add the WCRP-CMIP domain
We now need to add our domain to be whitelisted. The domains are:
```
wcrp-cmip.org
mail.wcrp-cmip.org
```
