ROR [Research Organisation Repository](ror.org) is a global, community-led registry of open persistent identifiers for research organizations. This gives us an ability to assign a unique identifier to each institution, which persists even after they have rebranded, merged, split, shut down, and re-emerged. 

*Rules* : <b> An alphanumeric string of 9 characters as defined by ROR.org entry. </b>
