## Introduction

There are several available methods to interact with the JSONLD files. 




### Direct interaction 



As the files are valid JSON custom scripts can be used to interact with them directly.

This means that you can download a local copy with 
```bash 
git clone <github repo url>
```
View them in the browser, or use the requests / GET api to download them directly. 

#### File structure
If using the github interface, you can navigate as normal. JSONLD files are currently located under the `data_descriptors` directory in each repository. 


If the user should so wish, they are also served using github pages, under the same filepath excluding the term `data_descriptors`. 

This means that the following activity page

[ https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/WCRP-UNIVERSE/blob/main/data_descriptors/activity/cmip.json
]( https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/WCRP-UNIVERSE/blob/main/data_descriptors/activity/cmip.json
 )

 becomes

[ https://wcrp-cmip.github.io/WCRP-UNIVERSE/activity/cmip.json]( https://wcrp-cmip.github.io/WCRP-UNIVERSE/activity/cmip.json)

 where the `.json` is optional, but helps the browser open the file for viewing rather than downloading it.
