Screenshots and usage to go here. 

## Installation 

```bash 
pip install git+https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/CMIP-LD.git
```
! warning
Beware that this repository is currently rapidly in development, and you will have to upgrade the installed version regularly. 



## Arguments
The arguments can be found by typing `cmipld --help` once installed. These are: 
``` config
CLI entry point for the JSON-LD processor. 
Process JSON-LD documents and extract dependencies 

To toggle between data and line mode, press 'm'. 
To exit the viewer, press 'q'. Maintainer: Dan Ellis (CMIP IPO)


positional arguments:
    url                   URL of the JSON-LD document to process

options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --deps, -d            Extract dependencies
    --relative            Use relative URLs for dependencies
    --no-compact, -nc     Do not compact the document
    --expand-ctx, -ctx    Do not expand context
    --no-expand-links, -nl
                            Do not expand linked documents
    --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
                            Output file (default: stdout)
    --no-interactive, -n  Interactive Playground
```

## Simple use case. 
The simplest use case is to view the url of a given file. The function recursively populates all the links if they exist. 

``` 
cmipld wcrp-universe:activity/cmip
```

This will give us in interactive view of the returned result.

### Collapsing entries
Should we want to we can also scroll down and use the spacebar to collpse any fields we are not interested in.

### Data View
For additional information we could also trigger the data view by pressing `m` to give us an alternative representation.

### Quitting
To quit the viewer press `q`.


## Getting all the dependancies. 
When opening a file, we get a small amount of additional information. For instance if we wish to open `cmip6plus:source/miroc6` we get a notification of the expansion of the prefix (to ensure this is correct) and a warning that one of the links does not appear to have resolved correctly.

### Listing all the links
To open all the links currently present in the JSONLD file we can use the `--deps` or `-d` flag when supplying our cli arguments.

## Saving the output 
To save the output, we can use the `-o` flag with the location and filename we wish to save. E.g. 
```
cmipld wcrp-universe:activity/cmip -o cmip_activity.json
```
## Rendering all items in a directory
Sometimes we might want to view all the items in a repository of directory. For this reason we can use the graph.jsonld file. 

For instance entering: 

```
cmipld wcrp-universe:activity
```
will resolve into 
```
https://wcrp-cmip.github.io/WCRP-universe/activity/graph.jsonld
```
which outlines all the files in the repository and displays them.

Optional extras to fix (these were working but changes in the code have rendered them temporarily disabled in the current version):
Compact view. 
Context Inclusion
